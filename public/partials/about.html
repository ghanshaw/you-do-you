      <h4><img class="logo-text" src="images/logo/logo-text-grey.svg"> is a simple todo app that I built to practice my skills on the MEAN stack.
      The app is built with <b>AngularJS</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>Sass</b> on the frontend, and <b>Node</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>Mongoose</b> on the backend. 
      I used <b>Passport</b> and <b>JSON Web Tokens</b> to implement authentication and session management. The app is deployed on <b>Heroku</b>.
      </h4>

      <h4>
      This app has many standard todo featuers: you can add and remove tasks, assign due dates,
      and view your progress with a glance. The app is also fully responsive. It serves as a good starting point
      for a more robust todo project sometime in the future.
