# you-do-you

YouDoYou is a simple todo app that I built to practice my skills on the MEAN stack. The app is built with AngularJS, Bootstrap and SASS on the frontend, and Node, Express and MongoDB on the backend. I used Passport to implement the authentication and Mongoose for database management. The app is depoyed on Heroku. You can view the live app here.

The app has many of standard todo featuers: you can add and remove tasks, assign due dates, and view your status with a glance. The app is also fully responsive. It serves as a good starting point for a more robust todo project sometime in the future.
